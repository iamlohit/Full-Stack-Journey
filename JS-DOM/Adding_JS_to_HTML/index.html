    <h1>Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Notes:
- The reason for having the stylesheet css file to be in the <head> has following reasons:
    - Style needs to be loaded first, else Style will be applied after the body is downloaded.
    - Remember, style can be added 3 ways - inline, internal and external.

- JS can be loaded in a similar way in a website - inline, internal and external. 
    - However there is a difference:
        - JS needs to be loaded as part of the body.
        - Since the browser reads the HTML file sequentially line by line.
        - So the style will be applied after the content is displayed without a style first.
        - When loading JS inline, it causes syntax issues with how HTML is read vs how JS is read. We can make it work, but its not elegant.
    Eg:
        <body onload="alert('Hello');">
            <h1>Hello</h1>
        </body>

    - When loading JS internally, as follows: This is easier to read, and does not collide with the HTML Syntax.
    Eg:
        <body>
            <h1>Hello</h1>
                <script type="text/javascript">       // This is a Script Tag in HTML.
                
                    alert("Hello");                   // This is typical JS code written normally between the Script Tag.

                </script>
        </body>

    - When loading JS externally, as follows:
    Eg:
        <body>
            <h1>Hello</h1>
                <script src="index.js" charset="utf-8"></script>        // This still uses the Script Tag but points to a index.js file.
        </body>
    - What is interesting about the Script tags position:
        - This needs to be positioned at the BOTTOM of the BODY tag.
        - If we position it inside the <head>, our website will get JS errors.
        - The reason this is, cuz the JS script might be referencing an HTML Element, that is not yet loaded on the browser.
        - Another side effect reason is, that the content needs to be loaded before the JS if there is alot of JS code.

NOTE: Try the above by changing/pasting/replacing the body and the head and script tags to notice.
