// So far we have been using JS in the Chrome browser's V8 Engine which is a JS runtime environment.
// Going forward as we lean into backend development, we are going to be working with Node JS runtime.
// Node is what brought the JS engine out of the browser lock and into the backend.

// Install Node LTS Runtime for mac. (Verify using "node -v" on your terminal)
// Run this file using the command "node index.js" from the folder containing the file.

console.log("Welcome to Node");
