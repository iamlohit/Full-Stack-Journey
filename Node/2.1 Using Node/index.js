// So far we have been using JS in the Chrome browser's V8 Engine which is a JS runtime environment.
// Going forward as we lean into backend development, we are going to be working with Node JS runtime.
// Node is what brought the JS engine out of the browser lock and into the backend.

// Install Node LTS Runtime for mac. (Verify using "node -v" on your terminal)
// Run this file using the command "node index.js" from the folder containing the file.

// The thing about Node is that so far, with JS, we have been running the JS code sequentially, line by line. i.e Synchronously.
// With Node, we enter the asyncronous, event-driven, JS runtime, that is designed to build scalable network applications.

console.log("Welcome to Node");
