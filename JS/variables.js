// Save's the string or any user input to the variable myName.

var myName = prompt("What is your name?");
// Prompt's the user with the value in " " and takes the input & stores it in a variable called myName.
// Type the name of the variable "myName" to get the value on JS console.
// Reason to call the keyword to be "var" is that its Variable & can be reassinged another value.
// Note: var is only used when creating the variable.
// Note: When you want to use or call the variable, you can call it by its name.

// This should print data contained in the variable to the output alert window in the chrome(or whatever) broswer.

alert("Hey there, " + myName + " Welcome to the world of JS!");
