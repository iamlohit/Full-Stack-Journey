// If you want to increase the value of x by 1, there are 2 ways to go about it:
var x = 5;
x = x + 1;
// or
x++;
// Both have a result of 6.

// Same goes for decrementing by 1,
x = x -1;
// or
x--;

// If you want to increase the value of x by more than 1, lets say 2, there are 2 ways again:
var x = 5;
x = x + 2;
// or
x += 2;
// Both have a result of 7.

// Same goes for decrementing by 2,
x = x - 2;
// or
x -= 2;
// Both have a result of 3.
